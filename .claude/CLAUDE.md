# Code Standards

This project uses **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code quality and formatting.

## Quick Reference

- **Lint code**: `pnpm lint`
- **Fix lint issues**: `pnpm lint:fix`
- **Format code**: `pnpm format`
- **Check formatting**: `pnpm format:check`

## Core Principles

Write code that is **accessible, performant, type-safe, and maintainable**. Focus on clarity and explicit intent over brevity.

### Type Safety & Explicitness

- Use explicit types for function parameters and return values when they enhance clarity
- Prefer `unknown` over `any` when the type is genuinely unknown
- Use const assertions (`as const`) for immutable values and literal types
- Leverage TypeScript's type narrowing instead of type assertions
- Use meaningful variable names instead of magic numbers - extract constants with descriptive names

### Modern JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use arrow functions for callbacks and short functions
- Prefer `for...of` loops over `.forEach()` and indexed `for` loops
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) for safer property access
- Prefer template literals over string concatenation
- Use destructuring for object and array assignments
- Use `const` by default, `let` only when reassignment is needed, never `var`

### Async & Promises

- Always `await` promises in async functions - don't forget to use the return value
- Use `async/await` syntax instead of promise chains for better readability
- Handle errors appropriately in async code with try-catch blocks
- Don't use async functions as Promise executors

### React & JSX

- Use function components over class components
- Call hooks at the top level only, never conditionally
- Specify all dependencies in hook dependency arrays correctly
- Use the `key` prop for elements in iterables (prefer unique IDs over array indices)
- Nest children between opening and closing tags instead of passing as props
- Don't define components inside other components
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for accessibility:
  - Provide meaningful alt text for images
  - Use proper heading hierarchy
  - Add labels for form inputs
  - Include keyboard event handlers alongside mouse events
  - Use semantic elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, etc.) instead of divs with roles

### Error Handling & Debugging

- Remove `console.log`, `debugger`, and `alert` statements from production code
- Throw `Error` objects with descriptive messages, not strings or other values
- Use `try-catch` blocks meaningfully - don't catch errors just to rethrow them
- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals for error cases

### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and under reasonable cognitive complexity limits
- Extract complex conditions into well-named boolean variables
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Prefer simple conditionals over nested ternary operators
- Group related code together and separate concerns

### Security

- Add `rel="noopener"` when using `target="_blank"` on links
- Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless absolutely necessary
- Don't use `eval()` or assign directly to `document.cookie`
- Validate and sanitize user input

### Performance

- Avoid spread syntax in accumulators within loops
- Use top-level regex literals instead of creating them in loops
- Prefer specific imports over namespace imports
- Avoid barrel files (index files that re-export everything)
- Use proper image components (e.g., Next.js `<Image>`) over `<img>` tags

### Framework-Specific Guidance

**Next.js:**

- Use Next.js `<Image>` component for images
- Use `next/head` or App Router metadata API for head elements
- Use Server Components for async data fetching instead of async Client Components

**React 19+:**

- Use ref as a prop instead of `React.forwardRef`

---

## Testing

- Write assertions inside `it()` or `test()` blocks
- Avoid done callbacks in async tests - use async/await instead
- Don't use `.only` or `.skip` in committed code
- Keep test suites reasonably flat - avoid excessive `describe` nesting

Run `pnpm format` and `pnpm lint:fix` before committing to ensure compliance.
