## Quick Start

Sylph UI is a trusted registry for shadcn/ui. You can start adding components right away!

```
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @sylph-ui/button
```

This will add the Sylph UI registry to your components.json:

```
{
  "registries": {
    "@sylph-ui": "https://sylph-ui.vercel.app/r/{name}.json"
  }
}
```
