## Introduction

Sylph UI is a component library built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) and [Base UI](https://base-ui.com). It provides accessible, customizable components that extend the shadcn/ui ecosystem with additional functionality powered by Base UI primitives.

## Installation

### New Projects

Create a new project with Base UI support using the shadcn/ui CLI:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init --base base
```

Or visit [ui.shadcn.com/create?base=base](https://ui.shadcn.com/create?base=base) to create a new project interactively.

### Existing Projects

If you have an existing shadcn/ui project, update your `components.json` to use Base UI:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json",
  "style": "base-vega"
}
```

## Adding Components

Sylph UI is a trusted registry for shadcn/ui. Add components using the CLI:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @sylph-ui/badge
```

This will automatically add the Sylph UI registry to your `components.json`:

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "@sylph-ui": "https://sylph-ui.vercel.app/r/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

## Why Base UI?

The `base-vega` style uses [Base UI](https://base-ui.com) as the underlying component library, providing:

- **Better Accessibility** - Built with ARIA best practices from the ground up
- **Flexible APIs** - More control over component behavior and styling
- **Modern Architecture** - Designed for React 18+ with concurrent features support

For more information, visit the [Base UI documentation](https://base-ui.com).
